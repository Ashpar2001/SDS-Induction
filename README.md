This repository contains the Reminder App that I made using
     1. HTML
     2. CSS
     3. Javascript (vanilla js)
     4. Cordova

All the files were originally inside the Cordova folder. But for the ease of access, I have copied them outside also. The apk file has also been pushed out.

The Cordova folder contains 3 folders, among which ReminderApp is the main one. It itself contains 5 folders:-
     1. hooks 
     2. node_modules
     3. platforms : Its the folder that is connected to AndroidStudio. Deep inside this folder is the actual apk file.
     4. plugins : If the app has plugins, there are in this folder
     5. www : This contains all the html, css and js files along with the additional resources like the app logo, alarm.mp3.
